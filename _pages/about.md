I began my journey in mechanical engineering at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, and I'm now continuing it with a master's degree at the Technical University of Munich. What’s driven me all along is a deep passion for space systems and the challenge of solving complex, multidisciplinary problems.

Recipient of the AUCANI merit scholarship.

My First Step into Space: IOAA 2019
------
In 2019, after years of dedicated study in astronomy and astronautics, I had the privilege of representing Brazil at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA), earning a Bronze Medal. From that moment on, I knew that aerospace systems would be my future.

Polisat: Turning Passion into Action
------
After arriving at the University of São Paulo, I wanted to turn my passion for space into something real. In 2021, I co-founded PoliSat, the university’s first nanosatellite group. We started as just four students with a bold idea: to design and launch a CubeSat from scratch.

As Mission Lead, I was responsible for overseeing the satellite design and developing the constellation architecture for our first mission focused on Earth observation to support forest regulation and monitoring.

We earned 1st place at the Latin America Space Challenge (LASC) and grew PoliSat from a small initiative into a team of over 40 students.

Academic Excellence 
------
While building PoliSat and exploring other extracurricular engineering projects, I remained committed to my academic journey. At the University of São Paulo, I remained the top of my class, ranked 1st out of 86 students with a GPA of 9.0/10.

Alongside my studies, I worked as a teaching assistant for four core mechanical engineering lectures:

Mechanics I & II (kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies)

Solid Mechanics I & II (stress-strain analysis, internal forces, and material deformation)

Master's at TUM
------
As part of a double degree between the University of São Paulo and the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I moved to Germany to pursue my Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a focus on Aerospace Engineering and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization.

At TUM, I deepened my knowledge through a series of courses in spacecraft systems, control, and optimization. For my semester thesis, graded 1.3, I developed a simulation framework that integrates Blender and Python to generate realistic orbital scenes for optical navigation research. The tool produces synthetic datasets under varying lighting, noise models, and orbital conditions, enabling the benchmarking of feature point tracking algorithms for autonomous spacecraft navigation.

Following that, I joined a research project on the co-design of flexible robotic systems, focusing on bi-level optimization problems that couple mechanical design with control. The goal is to develop a framework that minimizes control effort by treating both the control inputs and the stiffness matrix of the robot as design variables—resulting in flexible structures that can be 3D-printed in resin for physical validation.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
