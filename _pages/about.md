I began my journey in mechanical engineering at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, and I'm now continuing it with a master's degree at the Technical University of Munich. What’s driven me all along is a deep passion for space systems and the challenge of solving complex, multidisciplinary problems.

My First Step into Space: IOAA 2019
------
In 2019, after years of dedicated study in astronomy and astronautics, I had the privilege of representing Brazil at the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics (IOAA), earning a Bronze Medal. From that moment on, I knew that aerospace systems would be my future.

Polisat: Turning Passion into Action
------
After arriving at the University of São Paulo, I wanted to turn my passion for space into something real. In 2021, I co-founded PoliSat, the university’s first nanosatellite group. We started as just four students with a bold idea: to design and launch a CubeSat from scratch.

As Mission Lead, I was responsible for overseeing the satellite design and developing the constellation architecture for our first mission focused on Earth observation to support forest regulation and monitoring.

We earned 1st place at the Latin America Space Challenge (LASC) and grew PoliSat from a small initiative into a team of over 40 students.

Academic Excellence 
------
While building PoliSat and exploring other extracurricular engineering projects, I remained committed to my academic journey. At the University of São Paulo, I remained the top of my class, ranked 1st out of 86 students with a GPA of 9.0/10.

Alongside my studies, I worked as a teaching assistant for four core mechanical engineering lectures:

Mechanics I & II (kinematics and dynamics of rigid bodies)

Solid Mechanics I & II (stress-strain analysis, internal forces, and material deformation)

Master's at TUM
------
As part of a double degree between the University of São Paulo and the Technical University of Munich (TUM), I moved to Germany to pursue my Master’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, with a focus on Aerospace Engineering and Multidisciplinary Design Optimization.

At TUM, I took several courses in spacecraft systems, control, and optimization. For my semester thesis, graded 1.3, I developed a simulation framework that integrates Blender and Python to generate realistic orbital scenes for optical navigation research. The tool produces synthetic datasets under varying lighting, noise models, and orbital conditions, enabling the benchmarking of feature point tracking algorithms for autonomous spacecraft navigation. Then, I used this dataset to evaluate the performance of different OpenCV feature-tracking methods.

Following that, I joined a research project on the co-design of flexible robotic systems, focusing on bi-level optimization problems that couple mechanical design with control. The goal is to develop a framework that minimizes control effort by treating both the control inputs and the stiffness matrix of the robot as design variables, resulting in flexible structures that can be 3D-printed in resin.

Working Student at Ororatech GmbH
------
Since early 2024, I’ve been a working student at OroraTech, a startup focused on satellite-based wildfire detection and Earth observation.

As part of the mechanical engineering team, I’ve contributed to the development of a 16U CubeSat, with a focus on the design and validation of deployable solar array systems. My role includes designing mechanical components in SolidWorks, running physical validation tests, and simulating deployment dynamics. I also optimized spring mechanisms for solar panel deployment using Python, and wrote analysis for the Critical Design Review.

This role has connected everything I’ve learned in space and mechanical systems, and has also shown me what it takes to build real space hardware ready for launch.
